Some self-serving scripts for mpv, mostly for me to get familiar with Lua

This repository is just a dumpsite for me for any mpv scripts I create. I decided it would be nice to get familiar with Lua just for the heck of it.
Then after pondering how to do this, I figured I might as well write some scripts for [mpv](https://mpv.io) since I use the player a lot and there's some functionality I can think of that I'd like to have.

## Scripts to be found here ##
If the script doesn't exist yet, expect a branch to be made soonâ„¢. If you have suggestions, feel free to fork or contact me[\*](#Contact) about it!

# Contributing #
Branches in this repo will be ordered a bit different from most projects because I want to make contributing easy for all. And since this repo is supposed to be a collection, we don't want to accidentally push changes to an unstable file when another one has a stable update.

`master` is the classical branch for the stable versions of the script. Shouldn't change unless working updates are made. What's in here can be downloaded safely. Then there's the matter of adding new scripts or changing existing ones. This should be done by creating a branch named after the script. A few simple rules for both:
- Branch and Script names will be all lower case, with dashes or underscores to separate words;
- The choice between a dash or underscore is a free choice for whomever makes it; (both `yeet-pls` and `yeet_pls` are valid)
- Changes to a script should **only** be made in the branch of the same name;
- If a branch doesn't exist, create it;
- If a script is deemed stable and complete, the branch will be deleted after 9 weeks of inactivity;
- If you wish to contribute to this repo rather than fork, shoot me a message[\*](#Contact) and we'll see if I can add you;
  - It's advisable to have sent in PRs before you request being added to the repo.
