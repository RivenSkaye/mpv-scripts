# mpv-scripts #
Some self-serving scripts for mpv, mostly for me to get familiar with Lua

This repository is just a dumpsite for me for any mpv scripts I create. I decided it would be nice to get familiar with Lua just for the heck of it.
Then after pondering how to do this, I figured I might as well write some scripts for [mpv](https://mpv.io) since I use the player a lot and there's some functionality I can think of that I'd like to have.

## Scripts to be found here ##
If the script doesn't exist yet, expect a branch to be made soonâ„¢. If you have suggestions, feel free to fork or [contact me](#Contact) about it!
|    Name    |                Description                |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| [yeetpls](/yeetpls) | Delete playlist entries after playing them, or the entire playlist file when done |

# Installing #
For any and all of the scripts, they work as all mpv user scripts work. You put them in the global or user-local scripts directory. Information
on what folders these are on your system can be found in the [mpv docs](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#files).
As always, Windows is a special case, located right below the normal OS info.

For scripts with an `installer.py` (Python 3.x!) in their directory, just run that for easy setup. I might change it to take in script names later, so that a
single installer script can be used for every  script that comes to live here. But that's something to consider when more scripts appear.
Especially since I'd also have to take into account what scripts are single files and what scripts have directories. ~~unless I decide to just put
all single-file scripts into directories of their own as well to clutter the tree~~

As for making sure it works, _just stick to the directory structure here_ and it should work just fine. Copy folders as they are here and put the files in those places. Files in the root of the git
should logically be in the root of your scripts folder. If a script is multiple files, it should be a folder in the scripts folder that contains
a file named `main.ext` (where `ext` denotes the file type). **Never move a script file out of its folder, or shit will hit the fan**.
For example `main.lua` will be loaded, but it can't find any of its modules. Or a module will be loaded as standalone script, doing nothing _and_ causing `main.lua` to
throw errors. And that gives you those scary red messages on the CLI that make you panic and bug report.


# Contributing #
Branches in this repo will be ordered a bit different from most projects because I want to make contributing easy for all. And since this repo is supposed to be a collection, we don't want to accidentally push changes to an unstable file when another one has a stable update.

`master` is the classical branch for the stable versions of the script. Shouldn't change unless working updates are made. What's in here can be downloaded safely. Then there's the matter of adding new scripts or changing existing ones. This should be done by creating a branch named after the script. A few simple rules for both:
- Branch names will be all lower case, with underscores to separate words.
- Script names will be in camelCase, or as a single string.
  - Both `yeetpls` and `yeetPls` are valid;
  - `yeetpls` is preferred for ease of use on the CLI
  - Reflect this in the branch name using underscores
  - Use camelCase only if it's an important distinction to be made
    - expertsexchange is somewhat ambiguous, expertsExchange is not.
- Changes to a script should **only** be made in the branch of the same name;
- If a branch doesn't exist, create it;
- If a script is deemed stable and complete, the branch will be deleted after 9 weeks of inactivity;
- If you wish to contribute to this repo rather than fork, [shoot me a message](#Through-Discord) and we'll see if I can add you;
  - It's advisable to have sent in PRs before you request being added to the repo as a contributor.
  - In some cases of ~~favoritism~~ personal contacts, I'll add people I know and have faith in to write good code.
- For more info on script collections (for example `yeetpls`), look at the README in the top-level folder.
